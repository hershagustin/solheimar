# Sólheimar - Design Composition to Intrinsic Web Design Build

This project is my implementation of an intrinsic and fully accessible landing page based on a provided Figma design. The goal was to create a layout that adapts smoothly to any viewport width between **320px and 2000px** without causing horizontal overflow, while following semantic HTML, best practices, and accessibility guidelines.

---

## Overview

- Built a responsive landing page from a **desktop Figma design**.
- Developed a strategy to reflow and stack elements for all viewport sizes.
- Focused on **usability, readability, and accessibility**.
- Wrote all **HTML and CSS manually**, without external frameworks.

---

## Development Approach

1. Started by sketching a **mobile layout** at the smallest width.
2. Defined how each component (navigation, images, text blocks, buttons) would resize, stack, or reflow.
3. Noted hover and focus states for all interactive elements.
4. Implemented layout using **Flexbox, CSS Grid, and multicolumn techniques**.
5. Used media queries sparingly, only where needed for individual components.

## Key Features

- **Semantic HTML & Clean Code:** Proper heading hierarchy, accessible markup, and validated HTML.
- **Responsive Navigation:** Works across all viewports with appropriate tap sizes and interactive states.
- **Intrinsic Responsiveness:** No horizontal scrolling; containers adjust fluidly while maintaining max-width for large screens.
- **Accessible Interactions:** Keyboard and screen-reader friendly. All images have alt text; interactive elements use ARIA or visually hidden labels.
- **Readable Typography:** Font sizes and line lengths adjust for optimal readability across devices.
- **Optimized Images:** Compressed, appropriately sized images with multiple versions for different screen sizes.
- **Cross-Browser Tested:** Layout verified in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- **Lighthouse Audited:** Performance, accessibility, and SEO considerations applied.
